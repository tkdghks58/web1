      The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information
      space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform
      Resource Locators, which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are
      accessible via the Internet.[1] The resources of the WWW may be accessed
      by users via a software application called a web browser. English
      scientist Tim Berners-Lee is credited with inventing the World Wide Web
      while working for CERN on March 12, 1989, by submitting Information
      Management: A Proposaland writing the first web browser in 1990. The
      browser was released outside CERN in 1991, first to other research
      institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the
      Internet in August 1991. The World Wide Web has been central to the
      development of the Information Age and is the primary tool billions of
      people use to interact on the Internet.
